# Math Question Generation – Internship Assignment

## Overview
This project contains two newly generated multiple-choice math questions in the required output format, based on the provided curriculum and base question style.  
Each question:
- Preserves LaTeX formatting for mathematical expressions.
- Includes subject, unit, and topic tags as per the given curriculum.
- Follows the tagging format (`@title`, `@description`, `@question`, etc.).
- Contains one correct answer marked with `@@option`.
- Includes an image where applicable.

## Files
- **Math_Question_Generation_Output.md** – Source file containing both questions in the required tagged format.
- **pack_8_balls.png** – Image used in Question 2.
- **Math_Question_Generation_Output.docx** – Final Word document for submission.

## Tools Used
- **Python** – For drafting questions and formatting content.
- **Pandoc** – To convert the Markdown file into `.docx` format with embedded images.

## Steps Followed
1. Created two similar math questions using provided curriculum topics.
2. Applied the exact output format with tags:
   - `@title`, `@description`, `@question`, `@instruction`, `@difficulty`, `@Order`, `@option`, `@@option`, `@explanation`, `@subject`, `@unit`, `@topic`, `@plusmarks`.
3. Preserved LaTeX syntax for all math equations.
4. Added relevant image for the geometry problem.
5. Converted Markdown (`.md`) to Word (`.docx`) using Pandoc.

## How to View
- Open the `.docx` file in Microsoft Word or Google Docs to view the questions with formatting and images.

## Submission Notes
- The `.docx` file is ready for submission.
- The `.md` and `.png` are included for reference and source transparency.
